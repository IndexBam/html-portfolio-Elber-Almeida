<p>
  I am a med student who has learned how to code, loves learning about other
  cultures and also is really into the gym. I study in a state university
  (Universidade Federal do Sergipe). Thank God (or whoelse you believe in - or
  not) I don't have to pay for my studies.
</p>

<p>
  I was born in a small city in Brazil that is called Ipupiara. I lived among
  less than ten thousand people for most of my life.
</p>

<p>
  I really love learning new things and that is why I have also learned several
  languages. Among those languages, I am fluent in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>Spanish</li>
  <li>Portuguese (native language)</li>
</ul>

<p>And I know some:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Italian</li>
  <li>French</li>
  <li>Sweedish</li>
</ul>
